Recently, I saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1592811135832854529), and I have to say, I vibed with it a lot. I've read (well, at least parts of) many books on game design, and over and over again I see the same structure. First we have to talk about why games are so culturally important, and then we have to define "games" while making reference to the other hundred game design books that also define what it means to be a "game", and finally we start categorizing and classifying games, usually with some implicit bias that some games<a href="#[1]"><sup>[1]</sup></a> either aren't valuable or aren't "games". 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">one day I&#39;ll write a book on game design or programming that is purely vibes-based<br><br>no opinions presented as facts. no pretense. no pseudoscience. no cherry picked success stories or stats. just literally whatever I personally vibe with</p>&mdash; Freya Holm√©r (@FreyaHolmer) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1592811135832854529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, here are a list of things I vibe with:

1. Emergence + Simulation

Emergence through the simulation of simple rules (navier-stokes, rendering equation) is super dope.

2. Player has between 3-7 choices for any meaningful decision

If you have 1 choice, it's not a decision. 2 is too simple, too binary. 8 and above are too many for someone to consider at once.

3. Strategy over reflexes

```
code
```

4. Games have meanings - they say things

5. Photorealism and X-bit retro are out

6. Procedural generation is not enough

7. Games aren't meant to be played forever

8. Get your players consent

9. Design with and for interactivity


<a id="[1]">[1]</a> The biggest issue I see with many game definitions is that they exclude "walking-sim" type games like <em>What remains of Edith Finch</em>. The problem is not necessarily that I want to label these interactive experiences with the label of "game", but more that as a game designer I am interested in the storytelling and mechanics used in this software. In other words, if <em>What remains of Edith Finch</em> isn't a game then I don't want to just be a **game** designer, I want to be an **interactive experience** designer, which includes and subsumes games. Now, I may exclusively make interactive experiences that also happen to be games, but when studying the art of making games I am still very much interested in interactive experiences that aren't games, and therefore walking-sims are still part of my game design curriculum.
