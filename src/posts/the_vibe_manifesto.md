Recently, I saw a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1592811135832854529), and I have
to say, I vibed with it a lot. I've read (well, at least parts of) many books on
game design, and over and over again I see the same structure. First we have to
talk about why games are so culturally important, and then we have to define
"games" while making reference to the other hundred game design books that also
define what it means to be a "game", and finally we start categorizing and
classifying games, usually with some implicit bias that some
games<a href="#[1]"><sup>[1]</sup></a> either aren't valuable or aren't "games".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">one day I&#39;ll write a book on game design or programming that is purely vibes-based<br><br>no opinions presented as facts. no pretense. no pseudoscience. no cherry picked success stories or stats. just literally whatever I personally vibe with</p>&mdash; Freya Holm√©r (@FreyaHolmer) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1592811135832854529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, here are a list of things I vibe with:

### 1. Emergence + Simulation

> Emergence through the simulation of simple rules (navier-stokes, rendering
> equation, game of life, etc) is super dope.

### 2. Player has between 3-7 choices for any meaningful decision

> If you have 1 choice, it's not a decision. 2 is too simple, too binary. 8 and
> above are too many for someone to consider at once.

### 3. Strategy over reflexes<a href="#[2]"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

> I like to think that I will continue playing and enjoying video games for the
> rest of my life. It would suck to build kick-ass games, only to be able to
> really enjoy them for the next 5-10 years because your reflexes are just
> slightly too slow now to be good at the games you made. It's not inclusive to
> build games that heavily rely on reflexes.

### 4. Games have meanings - they say things

> Seems like an obvious thing to say, but games are a form of communication.
> Games that are aware of what they're communicating are much more exciting and
> interesting than those that just use mechanics for fun. Ultimately, games are
> capable of so many more emotions than the raw feel of fun, and it's about time
> game designers started exploring that larger space.

### 5. Photorealism is bad

> Photorealism is a bad style for a video game. The first issue with
> photorealism is that it doesn't clarify which objects are interactable and which
> ones aren't. Time and time again I have tried to open a door that was just a texture
> or to break a wooden object that isn't breakable. Games that use stylistic rendering
> are less restricted in their use of visual design to guide players.

> The second issue is that photorealistic games can't use powerful techniques to
> control emotion, like color grading.

> Overall, photorealism is a trap for game developers/studios/engines, and it isn't a target
> worth aiming for in the first place.

### 6. Procedural generation is not enough

> You cannot make a game interesting by _just_ adding procedural generation. A
> lot of indies are using procedural generation extensively because it seems to
> add a lot of potential for new content, but I'm not super impressed. Maybe
> this is a little hypocritical of me because many of my favorite games
> (Minecraft, Factorio, Spelunky, the Civilization series, etc.) feature
> procedural generation prominently. I just think it's overused and that gamers will
> appreciate good level design if you give it to them. Even in games that have a lot
> of procedural generation, the most memorable parts of the experience aren't
> the randomly generated ones.

### 7. Games aren't meant to be played forever

> Partially based off the 6th item, this strange fascination with "forever
> games" needs to stop. This includes roguelike indies, but also the much more
> insidious "live-service" games that are a stain on the industry.

> Forever games can never have a satisfying conclusion, because they aren't
> designed to conclude. There's no moral, and no place for reflection. Their
> stories are unchanging and boring, because if the story did fundamentally
> change you would open yourself to the possibility of the game ending. Forever
> games don't care about the player and their life. They are vampires that
> continually steal time (and money) from their player's life, making them
> weaker in the real world. As they become weaker and weaker (less social, less
> physically fit, poorer) they spend more and more time in the game world rather
> than in the real world, further perpetuating the cycle.

> Good games are designed to be put down, and for the player to return back to
> the tasks they need to do in the real world. Whether that's working a job,
> socializing with friends and family, exercising, and all of the other things
> that are required to live a full life. Good video games actually _enhance_
> those outside activities, because of the lessons taught within the game.

### 8. Get your players consent

> Good games get their players consent. Most games I see do this well for the
> large things (content warnings and the like) but sometimes they miss it on
> small things. For example,
> [why do so many games start with a cutscene](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/pq3mq7/developers_please_stop_skipping_the_main_menu_on/),
> before I've had the chance to change the settings to my liking? Now I'm
> sitting here watching this cutscene but all I'm thinking about is how I need
> to turn motion blur off before it gives me a headache.

### 9. Design _with_ and _for_ interactivity

> Talking about _with_ first, with interactivity means using development tools
> that allow you to be interactive with the game as it's running. I really value
> REPLs and other tools that allow you to modify the game as it's running. I've
> been looking into adding a LISP interpreter in my game for exactly this
> reason.

> _For_ interactivity comes back to "Emergence + Simulation", that is I want
> games to be interaction focused, and not choose-your-own-adventure books.
> Games are interesting as a medium because of interactivity.

<a id="[1]">[1]</a> The biggest issue I see with many game definitions is that
they exclude "walking-sim" type games like <em>What remains of Edith Finch</em>.
The problem is not necessarily that I want to label these interactive
experiences with the label of "game", but more that as a game designer I am
interested in the storytelling and mechanics used in this software. In other
words, if <em>What remains of Edith Finch</em> isn't a game then I don't want to
just be a **game** designer, I want to be an **interactive experience**
designer, which includes and subsumes games. Now, I may exclusively make
interactive experiences that also happen to be games, but when studying the art
of making games I am still very much interested in interactive experiences that
aren't games, and therefore walking-sims are still part of my game design
curriculum.

<a id="[2]">[2]</a> Fast games aren't necessarily reflex heavy - it depends on
what is required. Older people can play piano because it doesn't require
reflexes, just a level of mobility that (with good health) can be maintained
even into old age. It's more of the "peek around a corner and instantly spot the
pixels that constitute the enemy and click on them" sort of reflex that I don't
like.
