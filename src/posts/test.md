Over the past year, I've been watching the development of raytracing technology. With the latest graphics cards from Nvidia, AMD, and even Intel, it's looking more and more likely that real-time raytracing could become the new standard in terms of graphics technology.

I think this news has some people dishearted - there are several reasons why it's frustrating. First of all, these new graphics cards were developed at the same time as the pandemic, and at a time where Ethereum was still using PoW. Not only were the graphics cards expensive due to supply chain issues, but scalpers bought cards en-masse and crypto miners wanted a massive number of them too.

Secondly, even with the pandemic becoming less important over time, these graphics cards are still very expensive. An incomplete list can be found below:


| Graphics Card | Retail Price |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| RTX 3090 Ti   | $1,100 |
| RTX 3090    | $950 |
| RTX 3080   | $730 |
| RTX 3070 | $520 |
| RTX 3060   | $369 |
| Radeon RX 6950 XT   | $950 |
| Radeon RX 6900 XT | $700 |
| Radeon RX 6800 XT | $600 |
| Radeon RX 6700 XT | $420 |


Standard wisdom says that a graphics card should cost around 40% of your overall budget in a gaming PC. $1000 is a normal price for a gaming PC, so the average consumer can only afford a $400 graphics card. Almost all of these cards rise above that, and the next generation cards (RTX 40 series and RDNA 3) are even more.
