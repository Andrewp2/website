    <h1>My Internship at Cerner</h1>
    <h2>Duties and Projects</h2>
        <p>
            At Cerner, I worked on a number of projects. At first, I was tasked with addressing bugs in the current code generation utility.
            This code generation utility created a "gateway" which was used to test current dataaccess services. After that, I began my own project
            that would generate much more code to not just act as a utility to test cases, but as the dataaccess service itself. 
        </p>
    <h2>Skills learned</h2>
    <p>
        At my internship, I learned a large variety of hard and soft skills. I learned about code reviews, pull requests, how to use tools like
        Jira and Crucible, and how those all roll into the Software Development Life Cycle. I taught myself how to use StringTemplate to generate
        more code in a safe, extensible manner. Finally, I used Jenkins to build and deploy my code.
    </p>
    <h2>Presentations</h2>
    <p>
        At the end of my internship, I did a lightning talk on the work I had done that summer. I talked about how it could be used to dramatically reduce
        the time spent when creating new dataaccess services, or when modifying APIs for existing services. In addition, I made a video tutorial on
        how to use the code generator for any table in our database.
