          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineering major at Iowa State University. I am a
            senior, and expect to graduate in May 2020. Last summer (Summer of
            2019) I did an internship at Cerner, where I worked on a code
            generation utility for the pharmacy outpatient team. In my free time
            I like to play video games like Dota 2, learn more about computer
            science, and do software projects to broaden my horizons.

          <h2>Project Picster</h2>
          <p>
            One project I had in college was to create a website that could do
            style transformations. It used keras and machine learning to apply
            classic images like the painting "Starry night" to style a user
            uploaded image.

          <h2>Labyrinth of the Minotaur</h2>
          <p>
            My first major project was a dungeon crawler written in java. It was
            the first time I used git, or maven. Me and my teammates used Swing
            to draw the graphics, and found a library called kryonet to create a
            multiplayer server. The game is an infinite dungeon crawler, where
            you run around, fight enemies, pick up potions and keys, and attempt
            to make it as deep as you can.

          <h2>Chess Program</h2>
          <p>
            In a class on C and C++ programming, we had the opportunity to do an
            assignment on our own. I chose to create a chess client with SDL2.
            Although it doesn't support castling or enpassant, you can drag and
            drop the pieces, and it will exit at a checkmate. It's a couple
            thousand lines, and it was built in only a couple of weeks.
