          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineering major at Iowa State University. I am a
            senior, and expect to graduate in May 2020. Last summer (Summer of
            2019) I did an internship at Cerner, where I worked on a code
            generation utility for the pharmacy outpatient team. In my free time
            I like to play video games like Dota 2, learn more about computer
            science, and do software projects to broaden my horizons.

            My career objective is to use my understanding of algorithms and software
            engineering to better the world. In the near term, I want to get a fulltime
            software engineering job that is focused around big data in some capacity.
            After a number of years doing that, my main plan is to go to grad school
            to study machine learning,

          <h2>Project Picster</h2>
          <p>
            One project I had in college was to create a website that could do
            style transformations. It used keras and machine learning to apply
            classic images like the painting "Starry night" to style a user
            uploaded image. My work on it involved helping create a front-end UI 
            for the project, which was a website. We used Flask to build
            the website. One interesting part of this project was that we used Docker
            to keep our python environments all the same, so I learned the very basics of
            using Docker in this project.

          <h2>Labyrinth of the Minotaur</h2>
          <p>
            My first major project was a dungeon crawler written in java. It was
            the first time I used git and maven. Me and my teammates used Swing
            to draw the graphics, and found a library called kryonet to create a
            multiplayer server. The game is an infinite dungeon crawler, where
            you run around, fight enemies, pick up potions and keys, and attempt
            to make it as deep as you can. I helped code the game logic, and I 
            wrote a maze generation algorithm using BFS.

          <h2>Chess Program</h2>
          <p>
            In a class on C and C++ programming, we had the opportunity to do an
            assignment of our own design. I chose to create a chess client with SDL2.
            Although it doesn't support castling or enpassant, you can drag and
            drop the pieces, and it will exit at a checkmate. It's a couple
            thousand lines, and it was built in only a couple of weeks. In this project
            I learned about SDL2, and continued on my skills with Makefiles and C++.

          <h2>Hear Together</h2>
          <p>
            As of fall 2019, I am currently taking my capstone senior design class. In it, me and a team of seniors are making Hear Together,
            a hearing aid app for group conversations. Although we are still early on in our design, we have planned to allow our mobile app to
            connect to other phones with the app to intelligently merge the audio streams of each of the phones to create intelligble conversation.
            To the right, you can see a basic UI mockup that I've completed for the project.
